shoutcast-search CURVERSION
========================
shoutcast-search searches shoutcast.com for radio stations based on
criteria given on the command line. The application can for example
be used to automatically start a random radio station at startup or
as an improved and handy search tool for radio stations.

See http://code.k2h.se for more info.


Example
-------
The following starts my day: launch vlc with a random station playing
Chill with reasonable technical (128+ kbps) and musical (some
listeners) quality.

    $ shoutcast-search -n 1 -g chill -l ">50" -b ">127" -r | xargs vlc
