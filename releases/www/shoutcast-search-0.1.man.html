       shoutcast-search - search shoutcast.com radio stations


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>shoutcast-search</B> [OPTION]... [CRITERIUM]... [FILTER]... [KEYWORD]...


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>shoutcast-search</B>  searches  the  shoutcast.com radio stations. CRITERIA
       are used to search for station names, genres or currently played songs.
       FILTERS can be used to limit searches, for example by number of current
       listeners. Finally, KEYWORDS are used to search  freely  among  station
       names, genres and current songs. All parameters must match for stations
       to be listed. When no CRITERIA or  KEYWORDS  are  supplied,  shoutcast-
       search returns the current "Top 500" stations.

       <B>shoutcast-search</B> uses an API provided by shoutcast.com that may only be
       used for non-commercial purposes. See the URL in SEE ALSO for API docu‐
       mentation and rules.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>--version</B>
              Show program's version number and exit.

       <B>-h,</B> <B>--help</B>
              Show program's help message and exit.

       <B>-n</B> <B>LIMIT,</B> <B>--limit=LIMIT</B>
              Set maximum number of stations to be listed.

       <B>-r,</B> <B>--random</B>
              Sort stations randomly instead of by number of listeners

       <B>-v,</B> <B>--verbose</B>
              Verbose output, useful for getting search right.


</PRE>
<H2>CRITERIA</H2><PRE>
       Used  to  create  detailed searches, for example to search for stations
       with specific names or artists being played. You  can  supply  multiple
       CRITERIA of the same type, for example

           $ shoutcast-search -g Rock -g Pop

       to  find stations with both "Rock" and "Pop" in the genre. This is dif‐
       ferent from

           $ shoutcast-search -g "Rock Pop"

       where the program searches for the exact string "Rock Pop".

       <B>-g</B> <B>GENRE,</B> <B>--genre=GENRE</B>
              Search for stations with the word/phrase GENRE in  their  listed
              genre.

       in the form [=&gt;&lt;]N where N is a positive  integer.  "&gt;128"  means  more
       than  128, "=128" means exactly 128 and "&lt;128" means less than 128. "="
       is assumed if no operator is given, i.e. "128" is identical to  "=128".
       Note:  you probably need to enclose the expression in quotes, depending
       on your shell.

       <B>-b</B> <B>BITRATE,</B> <B>--bitrate=BITRATE</B>
              Filter stations matching with the bitrate in kbps  matching  the
              BITRATE expression (see above for format).

       <B>-l</B> <B>LISTENERS,</B> <B>--listeners=LISTENERS</B>
              Filter  stations  with  the number of current listeners matching
              the LISTENERS expression (see above for format).

       <B>-t</B> <B>CODEC,</B> <B>--type=CODEC</B>
              Filter stations based on the codec required.  Available  options
              are "mpeg" for MP3 or "aacp" for aacPlus.


</PRE>
<H2>KEYWORDS</H2><PRE>
       In  addition  to CRITERIA, you can provide KEYWORDS when you don't care
       where a word or phrase appear. KEYWORDS  are  matched  against  station
       names, genres and current songs. Separate KEYWORDS with spaces, enclose
       multiple word KEYWORDS in quotes, for example:

           $ shoutcast-search "Depeche Mode" somebody


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       Normal output is one URL per line  pointing  to  a  matching  shoutcast
       stream.  This  can  be  used to start music players with the applicable
       stations or to create playlists. For example, start  mplayer  with  the
       most popular stream currently playing a Depeche Mode song:

         $ shoutcast-search -n 1 -s "Depeche Mode" | xargs mplayer

       <B>shoutcast-search</B>  can also be used in --verbose mode. This is useful to
       verify that you have provided the parameters  correctly.  Verbose  mode
       also  prints  more  information  for  each  station,  needed for manual
       searches. For example, searching for two random stations playing  ambi‐
       ent music:

          $ shoutcast-search --verbose --limit=2 --random --genre=ambient

       prints

          Search summary
